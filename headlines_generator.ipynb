It forms the basis of how a bot would communicate with - not like how literates write books but like how we talk. In this Kernel, I'd like to show you a very simple but powerful Python module that does a similar exercise in (literally) a couple of lines of code. \n\n**Module: Markovify**\n\nThe Py module we use here is [`markovify`](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify).\n\n**Descrption of Markovify: **\n\nMarkovify is a simple, extensible Markov chain generator. Right now, its main use is for building Markov models of large corpora of text, and generating random sentences from that. But, in theory, it could be used for other applications.\n\n**About the Dataset:**\nThis includes the entire corpus of articles published by the ABC website in the given time range. With a volume of 200 articles per day and a good focus on international news, we can be fairly certain that every event of significance has been captured here. This dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/million-headlines/data)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"20078f4a4dbcf91fa5b78849209462c9cc7c56b6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Little About Markov Chain\n\nMarkov chains, named after Andrey Markov, are mathematical systems that hop from one \"state\" (a situation or set of values) to another. For example, if you made a Markov chain model of a baby's behavior, you might include \"playing,\" \"eating\", \"sleeping,\" and \"crying\" as states, which together with other behaviors could form a 'state space': a list of all possible states. In addition, on top of the state space, a Markov chain tells you the probabilitiy of hopping, or \"transitioning,\" from one state to any other state---e.g., the chance that a baby currently playing will fall asleep in the next five minutes without crying first.
